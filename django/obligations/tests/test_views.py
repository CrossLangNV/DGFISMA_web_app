Eligible liabilities must be issued by an entity that is located within the EU , otherwise it is possible that resolution authorities â€™ powers may not be applied . However , the 2018 MREL policy still recognises minority interests in subsidiaries ( i.e. own funds instruments issued to external investors ) as MREL - eligible to the extent that they are recognised in the own funds of the EU parent , if the foreign subsidiary is part of the resolution group of the EU parent ( i.e. the resolution strategy envisages that the foreign subsidiary would be resolved through the EU parent ) . 36 Banks are expected to tackle proactively the possible impact of Brexit . The SRB monitors the evolution of the stock and issuances of liabilities governed by UK law in the context of Brexit . Such liabilities are MREL - eligible based on the application of the current legal framework . However , the SRB will address on a case - by - case basis the possible effect of Brexit on the stock of MREL - eligible instruments ."
